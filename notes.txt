Temporary notes:

CREATING MOD MENU FUNCTIONS

Code to make on/off toggles in SettingsMenu.as in "LoadSprites"

Look into ToggleButton.as for how it behaves (and thus, TCButton.as)




Modify ModMenu to add name of your Mod
(could've made this a StaticData feature but with only 1 use, does it matter? Could possible make a matching function so you can see what's a mod and what's not when looking in minion-pedia)


Music button: X 4 Y 6
Sound button: X 36 Y 5

Character Creation Screen Propotions:

Main window: X 108 Y 139 (in MainMenuScreen l. 324-5)
