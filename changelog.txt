THINGS I CHANGED:

MinionDexID:
* Got rid of testing ID 
* Made the BattleMod IDs first -> everything else is +/- 3
  * this is needed so the BattleMod doesn't break it
* Removed total -> Now done in StaticData

Replacing references to total in the following files:
- AllMinionsContainer
- MinionPediaMenu

Added Zanyu:
- Image, SpriteHandler added
- BaseTalentTreeContainer -> Contains the new skill tree
- AllMinionsContainer -> Contains the actual minion
* ADD REWARD IN HATCHERY

Made the LoadData function take a 2nd parameter: a flag if this is the final loading
Edited in:
* FileSelectIcon

DONE StaticData:
* Added dynamic list to access modded DexIDs for minions
* Added Vector for all minion mods and all mods in general -> MOVES NEED TO BE ADDED
* Total minion tracker moved here

DONE DynamicData: 
* Added m_isMod, a dictionary that toggles each mod 
* If the LoadData has the flag as True, it then actually creates the final stuff
