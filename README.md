All the mods for Min Hero: Tower of Sages are to be compiled here, in a single file with customizeable options.


## USAGE:
* Download the "default.swf" from here
* Run with FlashPlayer (download from here or use your own: version must be 14+)
* Done!
This is forwards-compatiable, or you can use your old save with this one!
This is **NOT backwards-compatiable**, so if you create a save that contains Zanyu, it cannot be used in the normal game

### MOD TOGGLES
You can only toggle mods at the beginning of a save.
Due to the method that I have constructed the mod toggles, you can toggle the minion corresponding to a "species" toggle all of them. Make sure to double-check if the minions are actually there! You can do this by immediately opening the Minionpedia, and seeing how many extra minions beyond 101 there are. This should correspond to the number of minions you added. For example, adding Zanyu, and Stingaray, would mean 3 extra minions, so if you don't see a number 104, then you've not actually toggled them!


## CURRENT VERSION:
