All the mods for Min Hero: Tower of Sages are to be compiled here, in a single file with customizeable options.


## USAGE:
* Download the "default.swf" from here
* Run with FlashPlayer (download from here or use your own: version must be 14+)
* Done!
This is forwards-compatiable, or you can use your old save with this one!
This is **NOT backwards-compatiable**, so if you create a save that contains Zanyu, it cannot be used in the normal game

### MOD TOGGLES
You can only toggle mods at the beginning of a save.
Due to the method that I have constructed the mod toggles, you have to do certain "mods" in batches. See "MINIONS" tab in "Content" here for what ones need to be toggled simultaneously.
