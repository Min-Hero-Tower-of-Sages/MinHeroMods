All the mods for Min Hero: Tower of Sages are to be compiled here, in a single file with customizeable options.

Stay tuned!


## USAGE:
* Download the "default.swf" from here
* Run with FlashPlayer (download from here or use your own: version must be 14+)
* Done!
This is forwards-compatiable, or you can use your old save with this one!
This is **NOT backwards-compatiable**, so if you create a save that contains Zanyu, it cannot be used in the normal game


## CURRENT VERSION:
### Technical:
* Generates DexID for new minions
* Multiplayer code added (UNTESTED)
* Rearrangement of features to accommodate for modloader system
* Saves modded minions by ModName instead of DexID

### Content:

* Zanyu
* BetterGems
* Deleted SoGood intro (for the greater good)

## TODO:

Core (things that are present across all versions)
* Fix the spelling mistakes in the code. It's so easy to do, we might as well
* Add mod managing system (square_nine)
	* Make the loading system for new minions in save file work
	* Add GUI/Menu for toggling mods: delete minions as appropiate
 
Multi (things just for the multiplayer as that's going to enter here RAAH)
* Check BattleSystem for socket entry point
* How to make a TrainerDataObject work with OwnedMinion list? (might be a new class)
