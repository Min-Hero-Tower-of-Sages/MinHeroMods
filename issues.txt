All the issues that currently plague the SWF will be detailed here:


* "ArgumentError: Error #2025: The supplied DisplayObject must be a child of the caller."
  * When starting a second save
  * From activation of TopDownMovementScreen
  * Caused by m_roomBounds not being present in m_bottomVisualLayer of m_topDownMovementScreen
  * TO FIX: research how the hail does the roomBounds work, as there must be some kind of triggering thing that got missed....





VANILLA ISSUES (can be "ignored" due to niche case, solvability in-game, or quirk of Flash)

* When exiting a first-time created save slot but still within the tutorial courtyard, immediately plays the entry animation after returning to main menu screen
  * This bricks the game and prevents the save from being created (sometimes).
  * probably a result of test code when loading in triggering

* When loading into a level, might get teleported to 0,0 outside the map. 
 * Have to approach exit from other side to fix: a hassle
