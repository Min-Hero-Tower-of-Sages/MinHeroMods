All the issues that currently plague the SWF will be detailed here:


* "ArgumentError: Error #2025: The supplied DisplayObject must be a child of the caller."
  * When using "Skip" button before fading to text intro
  * From activation of TopDownMovementScreen
  * Caused by m_roomBounds not being present in m_bottomVisualLayer of m_topDownMovementScreen
  * TO FIX: research how the hail does the roomBounds work, as there must be some kind of triggering thing that got missed....

* All minions visible + appear to be owned in Minionpedia for a new save file
  * Seems to be caused by forced "True" defaulting during creation of the this.m_minionsOwned, this.m_minionsSeen of DynamicData



VANILLA ISSUES (can be "ignored" due to niche case, solvability in-game, or quirk of Flash)

* When exiting a first-time created save slot but still within the tutorial courtyard, immediately plays the entry animation after returning to main menu screen
  * This bricks the game and prevents the save from being created (sometimes).
  * probably a result of test code when loading in triggering

* When loading into a level, might get teleported to 0,0 outside the map. 
 * Have to approach exit from other side to fix: a hassle
