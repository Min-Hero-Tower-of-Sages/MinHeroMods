All the issues that currently plague the SWF will be detailed here:


TODO:
* Ask TxPoT about his rebalancing mod (make into a toggleable mod, it will work that way)
* Make Demo Video and post to YT
* Make guide for mobile
* Add Mod Menu scrolling (see Minionpedia)
* Add rest of minions (optional)
* Begin to add Ice Floor



* "ArgumentError: Error #2025: The supplied DisplayObject must be a child of the caller."
  * When using "Skip" button
  * From activation of TopDownMovementScreen
  * Caused by m_roomBounds not being present in m_bottomVisualLayer of m_topDownMovementScreen
  * TO FIX: research how the hail does the roomBounds work, as there must be some kind of triggering thing that got missed....

* Zooms into the main menu door when exiting a save file (occasional)
  * then errors as above
  * Seems to possibly be caused by the glowing effect around the dorr not existing during animation

* Caused by idling on character creation screen






VANILLA ISSUES (can be "ignored" due to niche case, solvability in-game, or quirk of Flash)

* When exiting a first-time created save slot but still within the tutorial courtyard, immediately plays the entry animation after returning to main menu screen
  * This bricks the game and prevents the save from being created (sometimes).
  * probably a result of test code when loading in triggering

* When loading into a level, might get teleported to 0,0 outside the map. 
 * Have to approach exit from other side to fix: a hassle
